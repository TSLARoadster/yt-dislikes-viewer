# Yt-Dislikes-Viewer

A Chrome/Brave browser extension that allows you to see dislikes on a youtube video after the youtube update

## Installation

Currently I don't want to upload it to Chrome web Store because I will have to pay a 5$ fees and there is a high chance google will reject this extension.

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/pgamerx/yt-dislikes-viewer/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Navigate to your browser's extensions page. It's `chrome://extensions` for Chrome and `edge://extensions` for Edge and **enable developer mode**.
3. Click **Load Unpacked** and, select the unzipped folder.
4. Once the extension is added to your browser, click the extension icon and enter your yt v3 Data API key (More info on the popup)

More reference on how to manually install extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest).

## Contribution

I cannot manage this extension on my own, that's why I need your support to keep it up to mark with the latest youtube updates. Feel free to star/fork this repo and work on it
